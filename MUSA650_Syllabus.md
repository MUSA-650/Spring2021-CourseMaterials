## Course Description

Satellite remote sensing is the science of converting raw aerial imagery in to actionable intelligence about the built and natural environment. This course will provide students the foundation necessary for application of machine learning algorithms on satellite imagery. Use cases include building footprint detection, multi-class object detection in cities and land cover/land use classification. The students will learn basic concepts of machine learning, including unsupervised and supervised learning, model selection, feature elimination, cross-validation and performance evaluation. After learning traditional methods and algorithms, the course will focus on recent deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks and their application on semantic image segmentation.

## Grading: 

50% for homework, 40% for project and 10% for participation. Your homework and project grade is not directly linked to accuracy of the final applications. Multiple factors, including data organization, model selection and presentation of the results will be avaluated. Your participation grade is a function of both in-class and Piazza participation. The Universityâ€™s Code of Academic Integrity will be enforced (https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).

Homework: Homework is assigned before the close of each class and is due at the end of the following week's class. Late homework will be accepted but penalized.

## Software

This course relies on use of Python and various related packages. The class will include interactive demonstrations on Google Colab. All software is open-source and freely available.
